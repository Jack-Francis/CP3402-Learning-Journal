# Learning Journal Week 05
## Learning Activities
I learnt about child themes in WordPress by following a LinkedIn learning tutorial as well as referring to the WordPress developer documentation.
Both of theses resources helped me to create a child theme folder containing a stylesheet named style.css, enqueue said stylesheet, and then install activate the child theme.

## Content Insights
Child themes are great because they store your theme customisations, allowing you to update the parent theme without losing any of the customisations you've made. Something I found particularly useful when experimenting with child themes was that if you 'inspect' a page you're trying to edit, you can directly edit the styling of the website. Once you're happy with your changes, you can simple copy the editted code over to your child themes stylesheet and it will overwrite the parent theme. However, if you don't like the changes you've made you can just reload the webpage and try again!

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Similar to my insights from last week, creating child themes is not a specific skill that an employer looks for, rather they are an assumed skill which falls under the broader title of 'Web Developer' (which [Seek](https://www.seek.com.au/jobs) shows approximately 2,900 job results for). Because of this, it would be important to keep developing skills relating to child themes if I want to pursue a career in web development in the future.
