# Learning Journal Week 01
## Learning Activities
(Content) I re-learned the basics of how to use HTML so I could add images to my website by using "img src". Most of the website design work was done for me as I opted to use a Bootstrap template which meant I didn't have to learn unnecessarily complex CSS and JavaScript to make my website look stunning.
(Career/Employability/Learning Insights) I learned how to upload a website and get it hosted on GithubPages by creating a repository named 'Jack-Francis.github.io'. I also searched for a hosting servive that was worked well with WordPress, even though I had already hosted a website. I ended up choosing Siteground, which I bought a year-long subscription to.

## Estimated Hours
Around 2 hours

## Content Insights
I found that SiteGround is one of the leading WordPress hosting providers; even being reccommended by WordPress.org. With that information, I knew it would be smart to choose SiteGround for future WordPress related activities. 

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
I believe that learning how to upload a website GithubPages will be very useful throughout my career as having my own permanent website is great for self-advertisement. I know I did not do enough individual learning this week and therefore will try a different approach in future.
