# Learning Journal Week 06
## Learning Activities
I futher developed my abilities of being an effective team member by following a 30 minute LinkedIn Learning course. I started to learn PHP from different course, but did not finish that one. I also learnt how to make a WordPress theme from scratch, and was able to apply this knowledge to create a very basic theme template for the group assignment.

Creating a WordPress theme from scratch requires a significant amount of time and effort, but it can be very rewarding. Doing so gives you full control over the look of your website, making it extremely flexible by allowing you add/remove plugins and features that you may not have been able to with a pre-made theme. However, to actually make a WordPress theme, I had to first learn PHP. The main insight I gained while learning PHP was how large the community is! According to [W3 Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php), PHP is utilised by 77.5% of all websites. This means that there are thousands of useful open-source libraries and tools for PHP, making it easy to find both resources and support for development. By beginning building my own WordPress theme, I gained knowledge relating to both PHP and WordPress development which should prove useful in my future plans and projects!

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
IT is one the most teamwork oriented fields, and according to this article on [Upskilled](https://www.upskilled.edu.au/skillstalk/career-paths-for-people-who-enjoy-teamwork), the majority of IT-related jobs involve working with clients and/or other teams within a business or organisation.  Another article, this time on [DocketHQ](https://www.dockethq.com/resources/importance-of-teamwork-in-your-organization/#:~:text=Teamwork%20is%20important%20for%20organizations,problems%2C%20and%20attain%20higher%20productivity.), references studies which show that IT organizations and businesses that emphasize teamwork; "innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly, find better solutions to problems, and attain higher productivity". These two articles are just two of many which highlight just how vital teamwork skills are for a future in IT, and that's why I have practiced working with different teams, with different people, in different environments, since early highschool. This has all been through group projects and extra curicular activities such as debating, Optiminds, and math and leadership camps. I have also experienced working jobs in different industries including fast food, fine-dining, and now software development- with no plans to ever stop learning!
