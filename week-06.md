# Learning Journal Week 06
## Learning Activities
This week I futher developed my abilities of being an effective team member by following a 30 minute LinkedIn Learning course; [Being an Effective Team Member - LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/being-an-effective-team-member/the-power-of-teams). I also started learning PHP from different course, but didn't finish it; [Learning PHP - LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-php-2/welcome?u=2223545)
. Another learning activity I underwent this week invloved creating a WordPress theme from scratch, [How to Create WordPress Themes from Scratch - Website Tutorial](https://blog.templatetoaster.com/create-wordpress-theme-scratch/), which I was able to apply and create a very basic theme template for the group assignment.

## Estimated Hours
Around 2 hours        

## Content Insights
I found that creating a WordPress theme from scratch requires a significant amount of time and effort, but can be very rewarding. Doing so gave me full control over the look of the website and made it extremely flexible, allowing the addition/removal of plugins and features that I would have had difficulty doing with a pre-made theme. However, to actually make a WordPress theme, I had to first learn PHP. The main insight I gained while learning PHP wasn't related to the learning, but how large the community is! According to [W3 Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php), PHP is utilised by 77.5% of all websites, meaning there are thousands of useful open-source libraries and tools for PHP. This made my learning simple as it was easy to find both resources and support for development. By beginning building my own WordPress theme, I gained knowledge relating to both PHP and WordPress development which should prove useful in both my group project and future projects!

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
IT is one the most teamwork oriented fields, and according to this article on [Upskilled](https://www.upskilled.edu.au/skillstalk/career-paths-for-people-who-enjoy-teamwork), the majority of IT-related jobs involve working with clients and/or other teams within a business or organisation.  Another article, this time on [DocketHQ](https://www.dockethq.com/resources/importance-of-teamwork-in-your-organization/#:~:text=Teamwork%20is%20important%20for%20organizations,problems%2C%20and%20attain%20higher%20productivity.), references studies which show that IT organizations and businesses that emphasize teamwork; "innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly, find better solutions to problems, and attain higher productivity". These two articles are just two of many which highlight just how vital teamwork skills are for a future in IT, and that's why I have practiced working with different teams, with different people, and in different environments, all thoughout my life.

I gained experience throughout my highschool years, working on group projects and extra curicular activities such as debating, Opti-MINDS, and math and leadership camps. I have also experienced working jobs in different industries including fast food, fine-dining, and now application development. With these experiences in mind, I believe I have set myself up for a successful career when it comes to working with a team.
