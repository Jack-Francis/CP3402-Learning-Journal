# Learning Journal Week 03
## Learning Activities
This week was mainly spent learning the basics of WordPress. I used SiteGround to install WordPress on my website which made integration easy.

On Friday, I met up with everyone in the Townsville class and participated in a group interview, where we all sat in a circle and asked each other questions. Since you (Lindsay) were unwell that day, I took initiative and asked all students at least two questions each, of which I had prepared in advance for the interviews. I gathered a lot of useful insights from this process which I think will prove useful in group formation.

## Estimated Hours
Around 3 Hours

## Content Insights
WordPress was extremely easy to install using SiteGround web hosting, it took me less than 5 minutes and allowed me to add any plugins as well as a template to suit my site. While browsing these plugins I found that WordPress is quite a secure platform, taking website security very seriously. Updates are regularly released to patch any existing vulnerabilities, and there are many security-related plugins specifically designed to prevent hackers and malware attacks.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
There were many insights I gathered from the interviews based around working style, availability, diligence, and shared expectations. I found that a lot of my peers valued fairness of workload when it came to group work, as well as good communication such that every group member was on the same page. But unsurprisingly, no-one really spoke about their weaknesses when it came to working in a group. It wouldn't make sense for people to voluntarily put themselves down when looking for a group of like-minded peers. In hindsight, I should have asked each person what they thought there greatest weakness was when working in a group, because I think that would have provided some very useful information for group formation. But overall, I think I made some excellent insights from the group interview and should be able to form a well-balanced group, granted they would all like to work with me.
