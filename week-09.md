# Learning Journal Week 09
## Learning Activities
This week, I focused on expanding my knowledge of Sass and Gulp. I utilized a variety of resources, including the official [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/guide) and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start/) documentation, as well as two LinkedIn learning courses: [Sass Essential Training (2015)](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sass-essential-training/working-with-the-automation-template?u=2223545) and [WordPress: Building Themes from Scratch Using Underscores](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-building-themes-from-scratch-using-underscores-2/what-to-know-before-you-start-this-course?autoSkip=true&autoplay=true&resume=false&u=2223545), which I had already started for my group project. By engaging with these materials, I both improved my proficiency in Sass and Gulp and gained valuable insights which I shall share below.

## Content Insights
**S**yntactically **a**wesome **s**tyle**s**heets or Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that has transformed my CSS workflow forever, by providing me with powerful features such as variables, mixins, and nesting. I discovered that using variables for colors, fonts, and other commonly used values significantly reduced repetition and made my stylesheets more maintainable as I no longer had to go searching to find the right hex colour code. Mixins, allowed me to reuse blocks of code across different elements, making my CSS more modular and efficient. And Nesting allowed me to write cleaner and more concise CSS code by structuring selectors hierarchically, simplifying readability and reducing repetition.


## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Not only has Sass given me a bunch of content-related insights, but it's also improved my learning. Sass has increased my productivity by providing me with features like variables, mixins, and nesting. Such features have helped streamline my CSS development, reduced my code duplication, and ultimately lead me to code faster and more efficiently. If I decide to pursue a career in web development, these base-level skills should greatly increase my employability as there are more than 2,250 jobs on [Seek](https://www.seek.com.au/front-end-developer-jobs) relating to Front End Development.
