# Learning Journal Week 07
## Learning Activities
I continued learning PHP by resuming the [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-php-2/welcome?u=2223545) course I didn't finish the previous week. I also learnt how to edit PHP using both [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm/).

## Estimated Hours
Around 2 hours

## Content Insights
This week, I practiced editting PHP using two different softwares; VSCode and PhpStorm. VSCode is a general-purpose text editor that supports a wide range of programming languages with is vast variety of plugins and extensions. PhpStorm on the other hand, is an IDE specifically tailored for PHP development. I initially began learning how to use VSCode for editing PHP, but the setup process wasn't the most straight-forward when it came to the the plugins and extensions required, and after seeing my friends chatting about how easy to use PhpStorm was, I decided to give it a try instead. PhpStorm has many out-of-the-box features such as code completion, real-time error highlighting, and tools for advanced debugging, with little-to-no setup. After my own practice and completing the practical, I thought that PhpStorm was a better than VSCode for editing PHP without contest. However, I ended up looking into the benefits of using VSCode for PHP development, since they were not obvious to me, and discovered that it is a lot less complex (in comparison to PhpStorm) to customize VSCode with plugins and extensions, which may enhance your workflow- plus VSCode is free.

To sum up, the choice between using VSCode or PhpStorm for PHP development really depends on your specific needs and preferences. If you require advanced PHP-specific features, and don't mind paying for a license, PHP Storm is an excellent choice. But if you prefer a more lightweight and customizable text editor (which is free to use) then VSCode may be a better fit.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
An important insight I made regarding learning involved how I tackled this practical- I left it to the last minute and ended up handing it in less than an hour before it was due. This is important because at the beginning of the year, I set myself a goal for the semester; to not hand anything in late. But I failed within the first month. I handed in one of the previous practicals a day late, as well as my first assignment. This realization made me ask myself “Is this really how I want to be?”

 Of course it's not! It is, however, evident that my current style of working is ineffective at best, and something needs to be done, but what can I change? From self-evaluation, I believe I am lacking motivation, as I find it hard to start a task. However, what I know for certain is that if my current style of working doesn't change, neither will I; not only will I be less employable in the IT field, but I won't have as successful of a career as I know I can achieve!
