# Learning Journal Week 10
## Final Learning Journal
This week's learning journal will follow a slightly different format since it is the final journal of the subject. I will reflect on key content, career, employability, and learning insights I have made over the last few weeks as usual, but also highlight how my personal workflow process has changed over the course of this class.

## Learning Activities
Over the past couple of weeks, I must admit that I have had limited time and energy to dedicate to my learning pursuits in comparison to previous weeks. The primary reason behind this shift was the sheer amount of assessment demanding my attention. Nevertheless, I still spent some time viewing the [Employability Edge](https://www.jcu.edu.au/employability-edge) modules on the JCU site. I also started exploring web careers from a variety of angles through the [Web Career Clinic](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/web-career-clinic/welcome?u=2223545) LinkedIn Learning course, by Lauren Bacon. I did not finish either of these activities but will certainly return once I have more time.

This sentence piqued my interest, so I looked online and found a [study](https://novoresume.com/career-blog/career-change-statistics), conducted this year, affirming her statement, saying "the average person will change careers 5-7 times during their working life." 

The first few main topics [Employability Edge](https://www.jcu.edu.au/employability-edge) explore:
- What Do I Want From My Life?
- Direction And Motivation
- Careers That Fit Your Interests
- Skills And Strengths
- Personality And Personal Attributes
- Career Choices

And to be completely honest, I hadn't really considered these (TOPICS?) until now. 

Earlier in the semester, I was having a massive problem with procrastination, so I did some self-evaluation to figure out why I was procrastinating
