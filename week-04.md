## Content Insights
While learning about local development and deployment, I began to understand just how crucial it can prove for developers to work both effectively and efficiently. Utilising local development environments, developers can test and debug their code quickly, since there are no wait-times for code to be deployed to a remote server. They are also useful in discovering any errors or performance issues before the site is deployed to production. I didn't need to edit my site in the local environment, but I can see the advantages of using one before deployment.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Local development environments are particularly usefull in a team setting as they allow for developers to test their code changes and updates without affecting the live website. They can share their code changes and updates in real-time with team members, ensuring that everyone is on the same page. However, when I searched [Seek](https://www.seek.com.au/jobs) for jobs relating to local hosting, I found barely any results. This is likely because local development is encompassed under the title of 'Web Developer' which had roughly 2,900 job results.
