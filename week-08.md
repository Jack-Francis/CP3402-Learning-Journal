# Learning Journal Week 08
## Learning Experiment.
This week's learning journal won't follow the same format as previous weeks as I was tasked to conduct a learning experiment using some form of the scientific method with a theory and test!

### Context of the Experiment
I always seem to unnecessarily postpone decisions or actions, I'm a pro-procrastinator if you will, but this week it has been particularly bad. For example, I only began working this Learning Journal on Monday (the day it was due) meaning I didn't know I needed to conduct a scientific testing method, which resulted in me having to fill-out this journal throughout the week when it should have already been completed.

Now that I've identified an issue with my learning, how do I solve it?

### Preliminary Research
The first step in overcoming procrastination is acknowledging that it's a problem. The next step is to identify the reasons why I procrastinate, so I began researching the psychology behind procrastination, accessing two very informative articles; [Why People Procrastinate: The Psychology and Causes of Procrastination](https://solvingprocrastination.com/why-people-procrastinate/) and [Why Do We Procrastinate? 12 Psychological Reasons Behind It](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/6-reasons-on-why-are-you-procrastinating.html).

After conducting this research, the two main reasons I believe I procrastinate are low motivation and a problematic working environment. I don't feel very motivated if I don't have much interest in a task and tend to put it off until it's so urgent that I just have get it done. I also realised that my bedroom (my primary study location) is a bit of a problematic working environment. My desk is quite messy despite my efforts, "cluttered desk, cluttered mind". I also always have my phone nearby and all it takes is one notification or vibration to disrupt me, even when it's on silent.

I knew that I wasn't alone with my difficulties to overcome procrastination, so I turned to 10 of my close friends and asked them how they deal with procrastination. I received a wide variety answers but the answer that stood out the most was from Joseph Hallows. Joe recommended that I use the '2 Minute Rule' as explained in the video [How to Trick Your Brain into Doing Hard Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkKBJQ0K9xE). The general gist of the '2 Minute Rule', is to tell yourself you are only going to work for 2 minutes, but by the time those 2 minutes are up, you tend to have the momentum to continue. Since I specifically struggle with starting tasks, I thought this method would be perfect for dealing with my tendency to procrastinate.

### Hypothesis
I hypothesize that employing the '2 Minute Rule', when I don't feel like starting a task, will help reduce the amount of of procrastination. by initiating the task, giving me a higher likelihood to continue working on, and even complete the task once the 2 minutes are up.

### Testing, Results, and Career/Learning Insights
I did not experiment with this method with work regarding CP3402 (Content Management Systems), instead I used it to catch up on some missed lectures and non-assessed practicals from CP3403 (Data Mining) since I was lagging behind on the subjectâ€™s content.

The '2 Minute Rule' proved to be a powerful technique in overcoming procrastination and enhancing my understanding of the subject CP3403 (Data Mining). By implementing this method, I committed to spending just 2 minutes, three times a night on the subject. This approach alleviated the overwhelming feeling of catching up on topics I thought were complex, allowing me to take consistent small steps. Within these short spans of time, I started with quick tasks such as viewing lecture slides. Surprisingly, these initial two-minute sessions often evolved into more extended study periods, as I gradually built momentum and engaged with the subject matter. I would set a timer, planning to only work for the allotted two-minutes, but I often ended up tricking my brain to continue studying for much longer periods of time, since I had already started. Through this incremental approach, I managed to cover significant ground, consolidate my knowledge, and bridge most of the gap caused by missing classes. 

All in all, I established that I have a major problem regarding procrastination. From self-reflection and self-evaluation, I was able to determine that this tendency to procrastinate likely stems from poor learning habits, distractions, and lack of motivation- and if I don't fix my current habits of procrastination before I finish university, I'm afraid I will not excell as much as I hope to in my future IT career. But on the bright side, my testing has revealed that the '2 Minute Rule' not only successfully combatted my procrastination but also began fostering a habit of consistent learning, which should hopefully lead to beneficial, long-lasting study habits.
