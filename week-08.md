# Learning Journal Week 08
## Learning Experiment
This week the main learning activity I underwent involved learning itself, but I'll need to provide some context.

I always seem to unnecessarily postpone decisions or actions, I'm a pro-procrastinator if you will, but this week it has been particularly bad. For example, I only began working this Learning Journal on Monday (the day it was due) meaning I didn't know I needed to conduct a scientific testing method, which resulted in me having to fill-out this journal thoughout the week when it should have already been completed.

I have identified an issue with my learning, now how do I solve it?

The first step in overcoming procrastination is acknowledging that it's a problem. The next step is to identify the reasons why you procrastinate, and to better understand this reasons why I procrastinate, I began researching the psychology behind it, accessing two very infomative articles; [Why People Procrastinate: The Psychology and Causes of Procrastination](https://solvingprocrastination.com/why-people-procrastinate/) and [Why Do We Procrastinate? 12 Psychological Reasons Behind It](https://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifehack/6-reasons-on-why-are-you-procrastinating.html).

After extensive research, the 2 main reasons I believe I procrastinate are:
1. Low Motivation: Definitely how I feel. If I don't have much intrest in the task, I tend to put it off until it is so urgent to get it done, that I just have do it.
2. Problematic Environment: I always have my phone nearby and all it takes is one notification to disrupt me, even when it's on silent.

After this preliminary research, I turned to 10 of my close friends and asked them how they deal with procrastination and recieved a wide variety answers. The answer that stood out to me the most was from Joseph Hallows. Joe recommended that I use the '5 minute rule' as expained in the video [How to Trick Your Brain into Doing Hard Things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkKBJQ0K9xE). The general gist of the 5 minute rule, is to tell yourself you are only going to work for 5 minutes,but by the time those 5 minutes are up, you tend to have the momentum to continue. Since I specifically struggle with starting things, I hypothesised that by utilising the 5 minute rule, I could bypass my habits of procrastination.

I did not experiment with this method for work regarding CP3402 (Content Management Systems), instead I used it to catch up on some non-assessed practicals from CP3403 (Data Mining) because I was lagging behind on the subjectâ€™s content. 

The 5 minute rule worked wonders. Each time I sat down, I didn't want to start the work, but I gave it 5 minutes and would consistently get into a groove!

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
From self-reflection and evaluation, I was able to determine that my tendency to procrastinate university work likely stems from poor learning habits, distractions, and lack of motivation. I've learnt that I find it very hard to start a task, but once I begin, I tend to have no problems completing it. One of the simplest methods of dealing with procrastination that one of my close friends, Joseph, shared with me is to [5 min rule]. 

If I don't fix my current habbits of procrastination before I finish university, I'm afraid I will not exceed as much as I hope to in my future IT career; which is exactly why I am making the change now, before it's too late...
