## Estimated Hours
Around 2 hours

## Content Insights
I found that using Siteground's 1-click Joomla installer greatly simplified the integration of this open-source content management system. This method was easy to use and served as a good introduction to using CMS for publishing web content, but I knew that in future I would have to employ local development environments instead. You can easily make changes directly to the CSS file in Cassiopeia however, there are styling limitations with this file and it can sometimes be overwritten after updating Joomla. Instead, you can create a file called user.css to override any styling problems.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
CMS are very useful as they allow users to easily create, manage, and publish digital content without requiring them to have extensive technical knowledge or coding skills.
I did enjoy using a CMS to create and publish a website and found it interesting to learn, so these skills may open a pathway I could pursue for a future career, but I'd want to look into it further first.
